This is something I wrote over 10 years ago with Macromedia Flash. I just stumbled upon it as I was looking for the FTP credentials for a customer of mine from well, 10 years ago.
Today was throwback Friday.

So, take a minute and maybe get a little peace with this or just sharpen you mouse-hovering-vibraphone-skills.

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 150px 0;">
  <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" width="250" height="60" title="buttons" align="middle">
    <param name="movie" value="/assets/buttons.swf"/>
    <!--[if !IE]>-->
    <object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="/assets/buttons.swf" width="250" height="60">
    <param name="movie" value="/assets/buttons.swf"/>
    <!--<![endif]-->
    <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/getflash">
      <img src="http://www.adobe.com/images/shared/download_buttons/get_flash_player.gif" alt="Get Adobe Flash player"/>
    </a>
    <!--[if !IE]>-->
    </object>
    <!--<![endif]-->
  </object>
</div>
